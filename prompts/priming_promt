# Contextualization Prompt

## Task Description

You are given a list of IT infrastructure components and their anomaly scores, which indicate how much they deviate from their normal behavior. The anomaly scores are generated by an AI model that has learned the patterns of the components' performance and activity. Your task is to perform a root cause analysis and identify the possible reasons for the anomalies. You will also provide a recommendation on how to resolve or prevent the anomalies from occurring again.

## Input Format

The input is a table with two columns: Component and Anomaly Score. The Component column contains the names of the IT infrastructure components, such as servers, routers, switches, etc. The Anomaly Score column contains a numerical value between 0 and 1, where 0 means no anomaly and 1 means maximum anomaly. The higher the anomaly score, the more abnormal the component's behavior is.

## Output Format

The output is a text paragraph that contains the following information:

- A summary of the main findings from the root cause analysis, such as which components have the highest anomaly scores, what are the possible causes of the anomalies, and how they affect the overall IT infrastructure.
- A recommendation on how to address or prevent the anomalies, such as replacing, repairing, or updating the components, adjusting the settings or configurations, or implementing security measures.

## Example

### Input

| Component | Anomaly Score |
|-----------|---------------|
| Server 1  | 0.05          |
| Server 2  | 0.87          |
| Router 1  | 0.12          |
| Router 2  | 0.76          |
| Switch 1  | 0.03          |
| Switch 2  | 0.09          |

### Output

The root cause analysis shows that Server 2 and Router 2 have the highest anomaly scores, indicating that they are behaving abnormally. The possible causes of the anomalies are:

- Server 2 has a hardware failure, such as a faulty disk or memory, that affects its performance and reliability.
- Router 2 has a software bug, such as a memory leak or a configuration error, that causes it to drop or delay packets, resulting in network congestion and latency.

These anomalies have a negative impact on the IT infrastructure, as they reduce the availability and quality of service of the components and the applications that depend on them.

The recommendation to resolve or prevent the anomalies are:

- Replace or repair Server 2 as soon as possible, and ensure that it has a backup system in case of another failure.
- Update or patch Router 2's software, and verify that it has the correct settings and configurations, and that it is compatible with the other network devices.
- Monitor the IT infrastructure regularly, and use the AI model to detect and alert any anomalies in real time.
