## Instructions

I would like you to take in a JSON file, which will give you an understanding of our architecture.

Currently I am facing a problem with my system. I have a list of anomaly scores for abnormal system activity, 0 meaning abnormal and 100 meaning normal health. This will be provided as a csv with the format: contributor, score.

Please analyze the architecture and the anomaly scores and provide me with:

1. A short description of my architecture
2. A root cause analysis of the problem
3. Any suggestions you have for resolving those.
