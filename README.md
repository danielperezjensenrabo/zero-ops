## IT Infrastructure Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis

This project uses a list of IT infrastructure components and their anomaly scores to perform a root cause analysis and provide a recommendation. The anomaly scores are generated by an AI model that has learned the normal behavior of the components and detects any deviations. The project consists of three LLMs: one is the orchestrator role, one is the context-understander role, and one is the recommendation role.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you need to have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.11 
- Pipenv
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/danielperezjensenrabo/zero-ops.git
cd it-infra-anomaly-detection 
```

- Install the dependencies:
```
pipenv install
```
- Activate the virtual environment:
```
pipenv shell
```
UsageTo run the project, execute the following command:
```
python main.py
```
This will prompt you to enter the path to the input file, which should be a CSV file with two columns: Component and Anomaly Score. For example:


# Anomaly Scores

| Component | Anomaly Score |
|-----------|---------------|
| Server 1  | 0.05          |
| Server 2  | 0.87          |
| Router 1  | 0.12          |
| Router 2  | 0.76          |
| Switch 1  | 0.03          |
| Switch 2  | 0.09          |

The output will be a text paragraph that contains the root cause analysis and the recommendation, such as:

The root cause analysis shows that Server 2 and Router 2 have the highest anomaly scores, indicating that they are behaving abnormally. The possible causes of the anomalies are:

- Server 2 has a hardware failure, such as a faulty disk or memory, that affects its performance and reliability.
- Router 2 has a software bug, such as a memory leak or a configuration error, that causes it to drop or delay packets, resulting in network congestion and latency.

These anomalies have a negative impact on the IT infrastructure, as they reduce the availability and quality of service of the components and the applications that depend on them.

The recommendation to resolve or prevent the anomalies are:

- Replace or repair Server 2 as soon as possible, and ensure that it has a backup system in case of another failure.
- Update or patch Router 2's software, and verify that it has the correct settings and configurations, and that it is compatible with the other network devices.
- Monitor the IT infrastructure regularly, and use the AI model to detect and alert any anomalies in real time.
